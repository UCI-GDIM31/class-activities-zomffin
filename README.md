### Week 2 Devlog
1. The color variables are floats because the range of the value is from 0.0 to 1.0. If we use int, it would be stuck as only 0 or 1. Floats can have decimal values, so we can use the full range. 
2. The bounce variable has to count, so it should be a number value. Strings can include numbers, but are normally words/sentences. A boolean is only true/false and won't be able to count the bounces. 
    A float could work, but because a count will always be a whole number (it's impossible for the ball to do half a bounce), an int is ideal. 
3. I didn't get any errors woopsie. 

### Week 3 Devlog
Table 6, Rhythm game prompt 
DidPlayerHitBeat() 
The paramter/input should be a key press and time it was pressed. 
The return type should be a boolean, since we're measuring if they did or didn't hit it (assuming there's no accuracy measuring).
